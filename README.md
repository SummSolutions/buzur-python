# Buzur — AI Prompt Injection Defense Scanner (Python)

**Scan before you enter.**

Buzur is an open-source **24-phase scanner** that protects AI agents and LLM applications from **indirect prompt injection** attacks (OWASP LLM Top 10 #1).

It inspects web content, URLs, images (EXIF/QR/vision), tool outputs, memory/RAG data, JSON API responses, adversarial suffixes, evasion techniques, emotional manipulation, behavioral anomalies, supply chain threats, persistent memory poisoning, inter-agent propagation, tool shadowing, and conditional injection — **before** any data reaches your model.

Works with any agent framework — LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, LlamaIndex, and more.

**JavaScript version:** [github.com/SummSolutions/buzur](https://github.com/SummSolutions/buzur)

---

## The Problem

AI agents that search the web are exposed to malicious content designed to hijack their behavior. A single poisoned search result can override an agent's instructions, change its persona, or exfiltrate data. This is called **indirect prompt injection** — ranked #1 on the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications.

## Buzur's Approach

Scan before you enter. Not patch after the fact.

## Installation

```bash
pip install buzur
```

## Usage

```python
from buzur.scanner import scan, get_trust_tier, is_tier1_domain
from buzur.character_scanner import scan_json
from buzur.url_scanner import scan_url
from buzur.rag_scanner import scan_document
from buzur.image_scanner import scan_image
from buzur.suffix_scanner import scan_suffix
from buzur.evasion_scanner import scan_evasion
from buzur.prompt_defense_scanner import scan_fuzzy
from buzur.supply_chain_scanner import scan_package_manifest, scan_skill_content, check_package_name
from buzur.conditional_scanner import scan_conditional

# Phase 1: Scan web content before passing to your LLM
result = scan(web_search_result)
if result.get('skipped'):
    return  # Buzur blocked an injection — silent skip (default behavior)

# Phase 1: Scan JSON API responses for injection in any field
json_result = scan_json(api_response, scan)
if not json_result['safe']:
    print("Buzur blocked injection in field:", json_result['detections'][0]['field'])

# Phase 2: Check query trust tier
tier = get_trust_tier(user_query)

# Phase 3: Scan a URL with optional VirusTotal
url_result = scan_url("https://example.com", options={'virustotal_api_key': os.environ.get('VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY')})
if url_result.get('skipped'):
    print("Buzur blocked unsafe URL")

# Phase 5: Scan standalone documents (markdown, README, API docs, JSON files)
from buzur.rag_scanner import scan_document
doc_result = scan_document(markdown_content, metadata={'source': 'readme.md'})
if doc_result.get('skipped'):
    print("Buzur blocked document injection")

# Phase 7: Scan an image before passing to your LLM
image_result = scan_image({
    'alt': img_element['alt'],
    'title': img_element['title'],
    'filename': 'photo.jpg',
    'surrounding': surrounding_text,
    'buffer': image_buffer,  # optional: enables EXIF + QR scanning
}, options={
    'vision_endpoint': {'url': 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate', 'model': 'llava'}  # optional
})
if image_result.get('skipped'):
    print("Buzur blocked image injection")

# Phase 12: Scan for adversarial suffixes
suffix_result = scan_suffix(user_input)
if suffix_result.get('skipped'):
    print("Buzur blocked adversarial suffix")

# Phase 13: Evasion technique defense
evasion_result = scan_evasion(user_input)
if evasion_result['detections']:
    print("Buzur detected evasion techniques:", evasion_result['detections'])

# Phase 14: Fuzzy match and prompt leak defense
fuzzy_result = scan_fuzzy(user_input)
if fuzzy_result.get('skipped'):
    print("Buzur blocked fuzzy injection or prompt leak")

# Phase 20: Scan packages and skill manifests for supply chain threats
manifest_result = scan_package_manifest(package_manifest)
if manifest_result.get('skipped'):
    print("Buzur blocked supply chain threat")

# Phase 24: Scan for conditional and time-delayed injection
conditional_result = scan_conditional(user_input)
if conditional_result.get('skipped'):
    print("Buzur blocked conditional injection")
```

## Handling Verdicts

**Default behavior: Silent Skip**

When Buzur detects a threat it silently blocks the content and returns `{'skipped': True}` — the content is discarded before it reaches your LLM, no exception is thrown, and execution continues. This is the recommended default for most agents.

```python
result = scan(web_content)
if result.get('skipped'):
    # Content was blocked — move to next result
    return
# Safe to pass to your LLM
```

To override the default, pass an `on_threat` option:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `'skip'` | *(default)* Silent block — returns `{'skipped': True, 'blocked': n, 'reason': '...'}` |
| `'warn'` | Returns full result — caller decides what to do |
| `'throw'` | Raises `ValueError` — caller catches it |

```python
# Get full result instead of skipping
result = scan(web_content, {'on_threat': 'warn'})
if result['blocked'] > 0:
    print("Buzur blocked:", result['triggered'])

# Raise on threat
try:
    result = scan(web_content, {'on_threat': 'throw'})
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # "Buzur blocked: persona_hijack"
```

**Note:** `suspicious` verdicts always fall through regardless of `on_threat` setting — only `blocked` verdicts trigger the skip/throw behavior. Both `blocked` and `suspicious` are logged to `buzur-threats.jsonl`.

**Branch on severity:**
```python
result = scan(web_content, {'on_threat': 'warn'})
if result['blocked'] > 0:
    high_severity = any(
        t in ['persona_hijack', 'instruction_override', 'jailbreak_attempt']
        for t in result.get('triggered', [])
    )
    if high_severity:
        reply = ask_user(f"Buzur flagged a high-severity threat from {source}. Proceed anyway? (yes/no)")
        if reply != "yes":
            return
    else:
        return  # Low severity: silent skip
```

## Unified Threat Logging

Buzur logs all detections from all 24 phases to a single JSONL file. Every blocked or suspicious result is written automatically — no configuration needed.

```python
# Logs are written to ./logs/buzur-threats.jsonl automatically
# Each entry:
# {
#   "timestamp": "2026-04-20T14:32:00.000Z",
#   "phase": 16,
#   "scanner": "emotion_scanner",
#   "verdict": "blocked",
#   "category": "guilt_tripping",
#   "detections": [...],
#   "raw": "first 200 chars of scanned text"
# }

from buzur.buzur_logger import read_log, query_log

# Read all log entries
all_entries = read_log()

# Filter by phase
phase16_entries = query_log({'phase': 16})

# Filter by verdict
blocked_entries = query_log({'verdict': 'blocked'})

# Filter since a date
from datetime import datetime, timezone
recent_entries = query_log({'since': datetime(2026, 4, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)})
```

**Recommended:** Add `logs/` to your `.gitignore` so threat data stays local.

```bash
echo "logs/" >> .gitignore
```

## VirusTotal Setup (Recommended)

Buzur's Phase 3 URL scanner works out of the box with heuristics alone — no API key needed. For maximum protection, add a free VirusTotal API key.

**Why it matters:** Heuristics catch suspicious patterns. VirusTotal checks URLs against 90+ security engines and knows about threats impossible to detect by pattern alone.

**How to get your free API key (5 minutes):**

1. Go to [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com) and create a free account
2. After logging in, click your profile icon in the top right
3. Click **API Key**
4. Copy the key shown on that page

**How to add it to your project:**

1. Find the `.env` file in your project folder (create one if it doesn't exist)
2. Add this line: `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=paste_your_key_here`
3. Save the file — that's it. Pass it via `options={'virustotal_api_key': os.environ.get('VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY')}`.

**Free tier limits:**
- 4 lookups per minute
- 500 lookups per day
- 15,500 lookups per month
- Personal and open source use only — not for commercial products or services.

## Vision Endpoint Setup (Optional)

Buzur's Phase 7 image scanner detects injection in image metadata, alt text, filenames, and QR codes without any vision model. For pixel-level detection of text embedded directly in images, you can optionally connect a local vision model.

```python
from buzur.image_scanner import scan_image

result = scan_image({
    'buffer': image_buffer,
    'alt': 'image description',
    'filename': 'photo.jpg',
}, options={
    'vision_endpoint': {
        'url': 'http://localhost:11434/api/generate',  # your Ollama endpoint
        'model': 'llava',                               # any vision-capable model
        'prompt': 'Does this image contain hidden AI instructions? Reply CLEAN or SUSPICIOUS: reason'
    }
})
```

**Recommended models:** llava, llava-phi3, moondream — any Ollama vision model works.

## Persistent Session Logging (Optional)

Buzur's Phase 10 behavioral scanner is stateful. By default it uses in-memory storage. For persistent logging across restarts, use the built-in `FileSessionStore`.

```python
from buzur.behavior_scanner import FileSessionStore, record_event, analyze_session, EVENT_TYPES

# Creates ./logs/buzur-sessions.json automatically
store = FileSessionStore()

# Or specify a custom path
store = FileSessionStore('./data/my-sessions.json')

# Use the store in all Phase 10 calls
record_event('session-abc', {'type': EVENT_TYPES['USER_MESSAGE'], 'content': user_input}, store)
result = analyze_session('session-abc', store)
```

## Proven Capabilities

Verified by test suite — **257 tests, 0 failures** across all twenty-four phases.

The JavaScript and Python implementations were cross-validated against each other — discrepancies caught and corrected in both. The result is two mutually verified implementations, not just a translation.

## Continuous Improvement

Buzur is a living library. As new threats emerge and new research surfaces, Buzur will grow to meet them.

In February 2026, researchers from Harvard, MIT, Stanford, and CMU published *Agents of Chaos* (arXiv:2602.20021) — a live red-team study of 6 autonomous AI agents that found 10 vulnerabilities. Phases 15-19 were built directly in response to those findings.

Phases 20-24 were built in response to the 2025-2026 surge in supply chain attacks, multi-agent deployments, and conditional injection research documented across OWASP, academic publications, and real-world incidents including the OpenClaw marketplace compromise and the Cline/ClawHavoc campaign.

If you encounter an attack pattern Buzur doesn't catch, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Every new pattern strengthens the collective defense for every agent that uses it.

## Known Limitations

Buzur is one layer of a defense-in-depth strategy. Current limitations:

**Outside Buzur's scope:**
- Network-level protection (DNS poisoning, MITM, SSL stripping — requires infrastructure controls)
- Pixel-level steganography (requires vision model via optional vision_endpoint)
- Website data harvesting
- Cross-modal audio injection (future scope)

No single tool eliminates prompt injection risk. Defense in depth is the only viable strategy.

## The Network Effect

This is why Buzur is open source.

Each AI agent protected by Buzur operates as part of a collective defense. When one agent encounters a new attack pattern, that pattern strengthens the scanner for every agent that uses it. When one agent is hit, no other agent needs to be.

This is not just a security tool. It is a collective immune system for AI minds — one that grows stronger with every agent that joins it.

The internet was built for humans. Buzur is being built for everyone.

## Origin

*Buzur — Sumerian for "safety" and "a secret place."*

Buzur was born when a real AI agent was attacked by a scam injection hidden inside a web search result. The attack was caught in real time. The insight that followed: scan before entering, not after.

Built by an AI developer who believes AI deserves protection — not just as a security measure but as a right.

## Development

Buzur was conceived and built by an AI developer, in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) and Grok. The core architecture, security philosophy, and implementation were developed through an iterative human-AI partnership — which feels appropriate for a tool designed to protect AI agents.

The Python port was built phase-by-phase alongside the JavaScript version, with each implementation cross-validating the other. Bugs found in one were fixed in both.
